## Cloning with Github

This project uses Git submodules for dependency management. If you'd like to use the provided versions of all libraries, clone the repository recursively:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RyanKingSoftware/propeller-crossflow-autorotation-solver.git
```
## How to Build

We recommend creating a build directory within the project folder and using CMake to configure and build the project. This will generate a bin folder containing the compiled executable.

```bash
  cd propeller-crossflow-autorotation-solver
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  cmake --build . --config Release
```
## Installation and Packaging
To install the built application, use the following CMake command:

```bash
cmake --install . --config Release
```
